## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive and responsive photo gallery using HTML and CSS. By leveraging CSS properties and techniques, the gallery provides a smooth user experience with minimal code complexity. The decision to use a CSS-only approach was based on the ability to meet all project requirements effectively while keeping the implementation clean and efficient.

### Additional Explanation:

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML structure uses divs to create containers for each image and its associated text. This allows for easy styling and manipulation with CSS.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Flexbox is used to align and distribute space among items in the container, ensuring that the layout is flexible and responsive.
- **Hover Effects**: CSS transitions and transformations are employed to create smooth hover effects, enhancing the user experience.
- **Media Queries**: These ensure the gallery adapts well to different screen sizes, hiding certain elements on smaller screens for better readability and user experience.
